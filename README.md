**Design**: It is up to you, but it needs to work on both desktop and mobile.

**Frontend**: Any Javascript framework, but we prefer React (https://github.com/JeanHules/react-boiler-plate).

**Backend**: Any PHP framework, but we prefer Laravel (https://github.com/JeanHules/laravel-boiler-plate)

In this role, you will often be the designer, frontend and backend developer. Build your application to meet the requirements below, but feel free to add functionality if you think there should be more. You are the creator of this product and we want to see not only how you design and code, but how you think and solve problems.

You can make your application as simple or complex as you want. Do not overthink it, but know that we want something built with lightweight code that is powerful for the user, and scalable for the company.
